# Rock Paper Scissors Game in Python
Rock Paper Scissors, known as RPS, is more than just scissors cutting paper, paper covering rock, and scissors smashing rock. This universally loved sport defies gender, age, athletic ability, and other barriers, leveling the playing field for all. RPS is the go-to solution for resolving conflicts, deciding who gets the final pizza slice, or allocating dish duty.

Despite its underlying complexity, the gameâ€™s rules are straightforward. Players deliver hand signals representing rock, paper, or scissors, with the outcome determined by these three rules:

1. Rock wins against scissors.
2. Scissors win against paper.
3. Paper wins against rock.
